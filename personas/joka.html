            <h3>Detailed Narrative</h3>

            <h4>The Great Exile (1028–1035)</h4>
            <p>When Cnut the Great overran Norway in 1028, Jóhanna—then seven—joined the royal flight into exile. First sheltered by her mother’s kin in Sweden, she soon entered the cosmopolitan court of Yaroslav the Wise in Kyiv. There, amidst Norse, Rus’, and Byzantine influences, she absorbed languages and diplomacy while observing hardened Varangian warriors who guarded the court.</p>

            <h4>Life in Kyiv (1030–1035)</h4>
            <p>News of King Olaf’s death at Stiklestad in 1030, and his subsequent sainthood, left an indelible mark on Jóhanna’s faith and identity. In Kyiv she received an education befitting a princess yet unusually martial: strategy, riding, and arms practice—customs not unknown among high‑status women of the Rus’ and in Norse saga tradition. Her half‑uncle Harald Hardrada’s circle reinforced these values of resilience and ambition.</p>

            <h4>Return from Exile & Move to England (1035–c. 1042)</h4>
            <p>In 1035 Jóhanna returned to Norway with Magnus the Good as he secured the throne. Yet, unwilling to serve merely as a political bride, she leveraged kinship networks to travel to England around 1042. Under Edward the Confessor, she cultivated alliances among the Anglo‑Danish aristocracy of the Danelaw, becoming a trusted ally of Earl Siward of Northumbria.</p>

            <h4>Current Status (1057)</h4>
            <p>At thirty‑six, Jóhanna is a well‑established landholder in the north. Siward’s death in 1055 has left Northumbria in the hands of the Godwinsons through Tostig, forcing Jóhanna to navigate a volatile court. She defends her estates and her father’s legacy while serving, unofficially, as the eyes and ears of her uncle Harald Hardrada—whose intentions toward the English throne are no secret.</p>
