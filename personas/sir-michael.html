        <section class="persona-story">
            <h2>Early Life & Squireship (c. 1395 - 1410)</h2>
            <p>Sir Michael's father was a veteran man-at-arms who had earned a reputation for bravery serving under the Black Prince, most notably at the Siege of Limoges (1370). His father was killed in a skirmish on the Scottish border years later.</p>
            
            <p>In recognition of his father's long and loyal service on the Scottish borders, the young Michael was granted the opportunity to page for a household knight in the service of the powerful Percy family, Earls of Northumberland.</p>
            
            <p>He was raised to a squire under the direct service of the most famous knight of the age, Sir Henry "Hotspur" Percy. He learned the arts of war in the brutal, fast-paced environment of the Anglo-Scottish border.</p>
            
            <p>He saw his first major action at the Battle of Homildon Hill in 1402, where, at age 17, his courage and skill in the fray were noted by Hotspur himself.</p>

            <h2>Military Career (1410 - Present)</h2>
            
            <h3>The Percy Rebellion (1403)</h3>
            <p>When Hotspur and the Percy family rebelled against King Henry IV, Michael faced a crisis of loyalty. Choosing to remain loyal to the Crown, he abandoned his master and fought on the King's side at the Battle of Shrewsbury.</p>
            
            <p>For his loyalty and proven skill, the King rewarded him by placing him in the service of a trusted royal commander, the Earl of Arundel. He spent the following years fighting under Arundel's banner in the long and brutal Welsh Wars against Owain Glyndŵr. In 1410, for his steadfastness and valour, he was knighted, becoming a Knight Bachelor.</p>
            
            <h3>1415 - The Agincourt Campaign</h3>
            <p>Sir Michael served in King Henry V's invasion of France. At the Battle of Agincourt, he distinguished himself greatly, holding his ground against repeated French charges and rallying the men around him.</p>
            
            <h3>1416 - Promotion</h3>
            <p>For his conspicuous valour at Agincourt, he was promoted on the field to the rank of Knight Banneret by a "Lord Terrence", acting in the King's name. This gave him the right to lead his own men under his own banner.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="order-of-stag-and-thistle">
            <h2>The Order of the Stag and Thistle</h2>
            <p>As a Knight Banneret, under the authority of Lord Terrence, Sir Michael established his own small household order, "The Order of the Stag and Thistle." This is not an ancient, formal order, but the name given to his personal retinue of knights, squires, and men-at-arms who have sworn to serve under his banner.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="current-status">
            <h2>Current Status (1420): The Alliance with "The Companie of the Badger"</h2>
            
            <h3>Situation</h3>
            <p>At 35, Sir Michael is a respected battlefield commander. However, maintaining a personal retinue is expensive, and the English Crown does not pay for standing armies between major campaigns.</p>
            
            <h3>The Contract</h3>
            <p>To keep his men paid, equipped, and battle-ready, Sir Michael has entered into a formal contract with "The Companie of the Badger," a larger, well-established mercenary company. He has not "joined" as a simple member; rather, he has contracted his entire order, "The Stag and Thistle," to serve as a distinct unit within the larger company for the current campaign season in France.</p>
            
            <h3>Rank & Role</h3>
            <p>Within the Companie of the Badger, Sir Michael is a high-ranking captain. He retains direct command as the Knight Commander of his own men (The Stag and Thistle), but operates under the overall command and contract of the Badger's leadership. This arrangement gives the Badgers the prestige and skill of a renowned Knight Banneret's retinue, and it gives Sir Michael the logistical support and steady pay of a large free company.</p>
