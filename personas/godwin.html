                <h3>Detailed Narrative</h3>
                
                <h4>Early Life & Youth (c. 1366 - 1386)</h4>
                <p>Born in the village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llantilio_Crossenny" target="_blank">Llantilio Grossenny</a> near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Castle_(Wales)" target="_blank">White Castle</a>, Godwin grew up in a family of carpenters. While he learned the family trade in his father's workshop, his true passion lay in the martial arts. He spent countless hours observing the Men-at-Arms stationed at White Castle, studying their techniques and practicing what he had seen.</p>
    
                <h4>Service with Hotspur (1386 - 1388)</h4>
                <p>In April 1386, seeking to test his skills in real combat, Godwin joined the army of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Percy_(Hotspur)" target="_blank">Sir Henry (Hotspur) Percy</a>. The campaign took them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais" target="_blank">Calais</a>, where they conducted numerous raids into the Picardy region of France. This experience proved invaluable, teaching Godwin the realities of warfare and the importance of discipline and leadership.</p>
    
                <h4>White Castle Service & Family Life (1388 - 1402)</h4>
                <p>Following the campaign, Godwin returned to White Castle and secured a position as a Man-at-Arms. In 1390, he married Edith Annabelle, a young maiden from the local village. Together they built a life in the village, raising two daughters while Godwin continued to serve at the castle. This period allowed him to balance his martial duties with family life, developing both his combat skills and his understanding of leadership.</p>
    
                <h4>Battle of Homildon Hill (1402)</h4>
                <p>In 1402, Godwin once again answered the call to arms, rejoining Sir Henry Percy's forces for the campaign against the Scots. At the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Homildon_Hill" target="_blank">Battle of Homildon Hill</a>, he distinguished himself by playing a crucial role in the capture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Douglas,_4th_Earl_of_Douglas" target="_blank">Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas</a>, the commander of the Scottish army. His actions during the battle earned him lands near White Castle, marking his rise in status and recognition of his martial prowess.</p>
    
                <h4>The Agincourt Campaign (1415)</h4>
                <p>Godwin's military career reached its zenith when he joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England" target="_blank">King Henry V</a>'s army for the campaign in France. At the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt" target="_blank">Battle of Agincourt</a> on October 25th, 1415, he witnessed the devastating effectiveness of the English longbow as 7,000 archers supported 1,500 men-at-arms against a French host of 10,000 men-at-arms. The battle resulted in a decisive English victory, and Godwin's contributions to the campaign were recognized with his elevation to the order of Chivalry as a Knight Bachelor.</p>
    
                <h4>Later Life (1415 - Present)</h4>
                <p>After Agincourt, Sir Godwin returned to White Castle and resumed his life with Edith. Now a Knight Bachelor, he maintains his martial skills while living a more peaceful life. He and Edith travel the lands attending tournaments, where he can demonstrate his prowess and honor while enjoying the pleasures of chivalric competition. His experience and status make him a respected figure in the local community, and he continues to serve as an example of the ideal medieval knight.</p>
