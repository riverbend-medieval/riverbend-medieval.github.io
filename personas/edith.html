                <h3>Detailed Narrative</h3>
                
                <h4>Early Life in Ireland (1371 - 1377)</h4>
                <p>Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicklow" target="_blank">Wicklow, Ireland</a> to an English father, George Moore from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereford" target="_blank">Hereford</a>, and an Irish mother, Aisling Byrne, the daughter of a merchant. Her early years were happy until tragedy struck when she was six years old. Her mother died during childbirth, and the baby did not survive either. This loss deeply affected her father, who struggled to care for a young child in his grief.</p>
    
                <h4>Life with Aunt Katherine (1377 - 1381)</h4>
                <p>In the wake of her mother's death, Edith's father's widowed sister, Katherine, came to live with them. Katherine took on the role of raising Edith, providing her with a proper education. Under Katherine's guidance, Edith learned fundamental reading and writing, developed skills in sewing, and received instruction in music. These four years with her aunt provided stability and education, but sadly ended when Katherine fell ill and passed away.</p>
    
                <h4>Education at the Convent (1381 - 1390)</h4>
                <p>After Katherine's death, Edith's father arranged for her to be educated at a convent on the English/Welsh border. This period proved to be a formative time in her life. The convent provided her with advanced education in reading, writing, and mathematics. She developed a particular interest in gardening and medicinal herbs, learning extensively from one of the sisters. The convent's location allowed her to develop a deep appreciation for the English countryside and its people.</p>
                <p>The sisters, while strict, were kind and included the girls in their weekly outings to local markets. These trips served multiple purposes: selling medicinal herbs, ministering to the local community, and providing practical experience in commerce and healing. It was during one of these market visits that Edith first met Godwin Black, who was selling wood products. Their friendship grew, and she eagerly anticipated the market days when she could see him.</p>
    
                <h4>Marriage and Family Life (1390 - 1415)</h4>
                <p>In 1390, Edith married Godwin Black, who was then serving as a Man-at-Arms at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Castle_(Wales)" target="_blank">White Castle</a>. They established their home near the castle, where they raised their daughters. While Godwin was frequently called away to serve the King in various campaigns, Edith capably managed their holding and family. Her education in both practical and domestic skills served her well in running their household and raising their children.</p>
    
                <h4>Life as Lady Black (1415 - Present)</h4>
                <p>After Godwin's return from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt" target="_blank">Battle of Agincourt</a> in 1415, where he was raised to the rank of Knight Bachelor, Edith became Lady Edith Black. This elevation in status brought new responsibilities and opportunities. Together with Godwin, they now travel throughout the land, attending tournaments and fairs. Her early education in music and her experience in managing a household continue to serve her well in her role as a knight's wife. Her knowledge of medicinal herbs and healing practices also makes her a valuable member of their community, as she can provide care and assistance when needed during their travels.</p>
