            <h2>Detailed Narrative</h2>

            <h4>Origins & Early Training (1377 – c. 1395)</h4>
            <p>Born in 1377 near Nottingham, Robert Fastolf was the son of a man-at-arms. His early life was shaped by the martial environment of his family and the ongoing conflicts of the era. His father, a soldier who later fought at the Battle of Margate in 1387, provided Robert with rigorous training in swordsmanship and the practical skills of a fighting man from a young age. This paternal tutelage laid the foundation for Robert's future as a soldier.</p>

            <h4>The Fowey Gallants (c. 1395 – c. 1403)</h4>
            <p>At about eighteen, Robert sought his own path and joined the notorious Fowey Gallants. Operating from the Cornish port of Fowey, they engaged in privateering and at times outright piracy, targeting French shipping and other vessels amid the Hundred Years' War. For roughly eight years Robert lived the dangerous and unpredictable life of a sea‑rover, honing his combat skills in shipboard skirmishes and learning the harsh realities of maritime conflict.</p>

            <h4>Man-at-Arms & The Battle of Blackpool Sands (c. 1403 – 1404)</h4>
            <p>Around 1403, Robert transitioned to formal service as a man-at-arms, joining his father. This period culminated tragically at the Battle of Blackpool (Slapton) Sands in Devon in May 1404, where English forces repelled a French amphibious raid. Robert's father was killed in action. Deeply affected, Robert took up his father's armour and shield, wearing them henceforth as a mark of respect and a continuation of his family's martial legacy.</p>

            <h4>The Agincourt Campaign & Beyond (1405 – 1416)</h4>
            <p>Following his father's death, Robert continued his career as a man-at-arms. While specifics between 1405 and 1414 are not detailed, experienced soldiers commonly found employment in garrisons or retinues during lulls in major campaigning. In 1415, aged thirty‑eight, he joined King Henry V's expedition to France and served dismounted at the Battle of Agincourt on October 25th. Enduring the arduous march and brutal fighting, he stood among the English who achieved a famous victory against a larger French army.</p>
            <p>As of 1416, Robert Fastolf is a thirty‑nine‑year‑old veteran, his character and skills forged by years of conflict. He continues to wear his father's armour, a testament to his past and enduring commitment to the life of a soldier.</p>
