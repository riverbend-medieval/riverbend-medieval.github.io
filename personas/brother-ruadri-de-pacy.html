            <h2>Detailed Narrative</h2>

            <h4>Origins & Calling</h4>
            <p>As the second son of a minor Norman house settled in Scotland, Ruadrí’s path lay in service. His father’s vow and the family’s ties to the Order of St. John led to his placement with the Hospitallers, where his toughness and discipline quickly marked him for soldierly duty.</p>

            <h4>Formed on the Frontier</h4>
            <p>At Castle Margat, a crucial Hospitaller stronghold, Ruadrí’s formative years were spent under veteran captains. Patrols along the frontier honed his endurance and close‑quarters skill. Though his Gaelic tongue set him apart, his sword‑arm needed no translation.</p>

            <h4>Acre: Trial by Fire</h4>
            <p>During the long Siege of Acre, Ruadrí served in the foremost ranks—hauling mantlets, storming breaches, and holding lines under counter‑attack. His reliability under pressure earned him respect among the Sergeant‑Brethren, with future advancement dependent on continued distinction in the field.</p>
