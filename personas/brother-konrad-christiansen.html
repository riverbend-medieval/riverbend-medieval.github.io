            <h2>Detailed Narrative</h2>

            <h4>Origins near Antvorskov</h4>
            <p>Raised near the Hospitaller commandery at Antvorskov, Konrad’s survival from a severe fever led his family to tithe him to the Order. His early schooling included Latin, which later opened the door to studying medical treatises within the community of the sick and poor the Hospitallers served.</p>

            <h4>Formation at Castle Margat</h4>
            <p>After entry at Antvorskov, Konrad was sent east to Castle Margat. There he combined martial drill with practical healing—compounding simples, preparing balms, and dressing wounds—under the direction of experienced brothers.</p>

            <h4>Infirmary Service and Arms</h4>
            <p>Placed under a Knight‑Brother managing the Margat infirmary, Konrad learned to balance the Order’s dual vocation: caritas and militia. Though his daily labour served the sick, he never neglected the arms‑training required of a Hospitaller.</p>

            <h4>Acre: Surgeon and Soldier</h4>
            <p>During the long Siege of Acre, Konrad’s work in the camp hospital was relentless. He tended the wounded, managed fevers and flux, and when the lines were threatened, he took his place on the defences alongside his brothers, embodying the Hospitaller ideal.</p>
