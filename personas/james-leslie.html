            <h2>Detailed Narrative</h2>

            <h4>Orphaned & Early Life (1361 – c. 1370)</h4>
            <p>In 1361, the pestis secunda tore through Exeter. James’s mother succumbed, and with his father often campaigning, the boy learned to survive in the alleys and markets of the city. By the end of the decade his father had fallen in fighting around Poitou, leaving James truly alone—hard, wary, and quick with his fists.</p>

            <h4>The Spice Trade (c. 1372 – 1378)</h4>
            <p>Work as a dockside guard put James in the orbit of Exeter’s merchant elite. His aptitude for violence and his keen eye for risk saw him rise from warehouse watchman to escort for high‑value cargos. In 1375, when thieves struck the warehouse, his ruthless response protected the goods. Rewarded with a small stake in a pepper shipment, he tasted his first real profit.</p>

            <h4>Transition to Mercenary (1378 – Present)</h4>
            <p>Money alone could not still his restlessness. The tales of free companies—of ransoms, plunder, and swift advancement—drew him across the Channel. He invested in a proper kit: maile and breastplate, a sound bascinet with visor, good gauntlets and greaves, and a reliable war horse. He is no nobleman, but he is every inch a professional soldier.</p>

            <h4>Current Status (1380)</h4>
            <p>Now thirty and blooded in skirmishes, James has found a berth with the Companie of the Badger, an English‑rooted free company active in France. With steel in hand and decent armour on his back, he means to make his fortune—or die trying.</p>
