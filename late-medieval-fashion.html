                            <p>Changes in men's headwear: Simple felt caps worn over hoods decline in popularity, replaced by taller varieties often paired with scarves. Hoods are commonly worn as capes rather than head coverings. Close-fitting coifs begin their gradual decline in fashion, though still widely worn.</p>

                            <p>Introduction of more elaborate hoods and hats for men, marking a shift from basic hoods. The men's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotehardie" target="_blank">cotehardie</a> becomes popular, featuring a fitted silhouette with buttoned front closure.</p>

                            <p>Essential accessories: Gloves are a standard part of outdoor attire for both men and women across all social classes. Wealthy individuals wear fine leather gloves in pale colors or matching their garments, while the working classes use heavy mittens for protection and warmth.</p>

                            <p>Development of outerwear: Cloaks and mantles become standardized in their cut, with most being circular in shape and typically 3/4 length or longer. Cloaks extend to the ankle for weather protection, while mantles serve as fashion items. Men's cloaks feature three-button fastenings near the neck, while women's mantles continue the late 13th-century tradition of metal 'boss' fastenings.</p>

                            <p>Significant changes in women's headwear: The wrapped kerchief and wimple decline in popularity, with the wimple becoming primarily worn by elderly women and nuns. Working women begin wearing open hoods. Women's hairstyles shift from the chaplet to vertical plaits worn under veils attached to filets or circlets. The frilled 'nebula' headdress emerges as a popular style.</p>

                            <p>Men's accessories: Belts are worn slightly long at the hip with buckles and strap ends, often knotted over. Noblemen wear decorative 'knightly girdles' adorned with metal plaques. Kidney-shaped belt pouches become common, featuring separate internal coin bags. Gowns are worn belted at the natural waist.</p>

                            <p>Footwear developments: The turnshoe style dominates footwear fashion. Both men's and women's shoes feature pointed toes in the Poulaine (or Krakow) style and are fastened with buttons and laces. Wealthy individuals protect their expensive shoes with pattens - wooden soles strapped over the shoes, shaped to match the shoe style and up to four inches high.</p>

Knee or thigh-high tight leather boots with buckled leg fastenings emerge, featuring foldable top cuffs. The pointed Poulaine style continues to be popular across all social classes.</p>
